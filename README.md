### YOLOv5 Object Detection Mobile App

**Overview:**
This Flutter application leverages the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) object detection model to perform real-time object detection and room classification. The app allows users to select multiple images and sends them to a Flask backend API, which processes the images and returns detected objects and their classifications.

**Features:**

- **Image Selection:** Users can pick multiple images from their device gallery using an intuitive interface.
- **Object Detection:** The app communicates with a Flask-based API to send the selected images. The API uses the YOLOv5 model to detect objects within the images and classify the type of room depicted.
- **Results Display:** Detected objects and room classifications are displayed beneath each image, providing users with immediate feedback on the detection results.
- **Advanced Detection Option:** Users can toggle an advanced detection feature, which could be further enhanced to include additional functionalities like customized detection settings.
- **Responsive UI:** The app features a visually appealing design with organized layout and interactive elements, enhancing user experience.

**How It Works:**
1. **Image Selection:** Users initiate the image selection process by tapping the "Pick Images" button, allowing them to choose multiple images.
2. **API Communication:** Once images are selected, they are uploaded to the Flask API using a multipart HTTP request.
3. **Object Detection:** The Flask backend processes the images with the YOLOv5 model, detecting objects and classifying the room type.
4. **Result Presentation:** The results are returned to the app, which updates the UI to show detected objects and classifications for each image.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Backend:** Flask for handling HTTP requests and serving the YOLOv5 model.
- **Model:** YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.
